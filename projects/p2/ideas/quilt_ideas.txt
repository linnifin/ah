1. Base it off of a dream

	a. 

2. Base it off of a moment in time/your life I guess
	
	a. Wave- At Refugio beach with a bunch of friends. Don't have any bougey boards or surf boards
	so just go out in the water to play in the waves. Get out pretty far, water is up to our
	shoulders. Diving under waves. Water is loud, the ocean roars in your ears. Open your eyes 
	under water but the water is too murky to see anything besides the sand on the ground beneath 
	you. It's cloudy, so the water isn't very bright either. Standing there and talking waiting
	for the next wave. One of our friends once met a young tiger shark here while she was surfing.
	Start wondering if there are any sharks or fish swimming near us. The next swell appears on the 
	horizon. It starts a little farther back
	than the rest. Start to realize it's gonna be a big wave, like a surfer's dream. Panic, we're
	too small for it. What happens if it breaks on top of us? Friends move closer to prevent this.
	Still panicing, it's too big. It starts to crest above us. Friends dive under. Shout for your
	friend, you don't know what to do. There's no escape. Normally you'd run away, or just freeze
	and have a panic attack. But there's no other option. Your mind goes quiet, all anxiety ceases.
	You dive under the wave, it passes over you like any other wave. Everyone resurfaces after it
	passes. Excitement. Joy. Relief. Inside, you feel calm, serene, in control, for the first time
	in your life.
